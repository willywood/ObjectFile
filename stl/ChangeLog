The following changes were made since 3.2 release:

	* Now, by default, STLPort renames std:: namespace for user
	  if __STL_USE_OWN_NAMESPACE is used. To make it possible, many new
	  wrapper headers introduced. Internally, STLport uses stlport:: namespace,
	  so no link- or run- time clashes are possible, and you don't have to rebuild
	  the runtime lib (which you don't want to).
	  This feature makes STLport usable out-of-the box, without any modifications
	  for client code, with any compiler.

	* Code bloat reduction : hashtable<T> uses vector<void*> internally.

	* Vector : efficiency/code bloat reduction fixes.

	* Visual C++ : DLL export is supported for allocators and strings. To use it, 
	  please define __STL_USE_DECLSPEC in all modules and __STL_DESIGNATED_DLL
	  for the DLL which is supposed to instantiate STLport exports (at least one
	  source of this DLL must include <string>.

        * Visual C++ : for MT synchronization, <windows.h> is not included anymore.
	
	* For Sunpro C++ 5.0 : all headers are linked into stlport/SC5, so only
	  one include path is needed. Note that SC5.0 has problems with relative 
	  search path. It is easy to work around : in your makefiles, instead of
	  "STL_INCL=../.." , write "STL_INCL=${PWD}/../..".

	* Configuration files provided for compilers : 
	   KAI C++
	   DEC C++ (6.x, 5.x)
	   Borland 5.02 is back on the road (finally !)
	  
	* Windows CE config provided for Visual C++.

	* __STL_NO_IOSTREAMS switch introduced for embedded platforms.
	
	* Lots of minor config fixes and improvements for various platforms.
