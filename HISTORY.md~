ObjectFile Changes

Functional changes to ObjectFile are described.

========================== ObjectFile 4. 10 ============================
1. Linux support. Includes project Linux 

========================== ObjectFile 4. 00 ============================
1. Android support. Includes project from ndk build. 

========================== ObjectFile 2. 02 ============================

1.Borland CPP Builder 5.0  project is supplied. projects/win32/BorlandCPP5/ofile.bpg
2. XML output stream throws exceptions on failure to write.

========================== ObjectFile 2. 01 ============================

1.MSVC 6.0 project is supplied. projects/win32/msvc/ofile.dsw

========================== ObjectFile 2. 00 ============================

1. Support for files greater than 4Mb on platforms that support files of this size. Tested on Windows 2000. This is configurable via a define since it has file portability implications.
2. Support for storing 64-bit longs.
3. XML output stream improved. Offers more control over output style.

========================== ObjectFile 1.92 =============================

1. Overhaul of OIStream and blob read methods, in preparation for
XML reader (planned for version 2.0). It should now be possible to handle
reading of Blobs from a user derived class of OIStream. 
2. Some fixes to oset.h and odset.h due to reported compilation problem
on HP ANSI C++ B3910B A.01.23.

========================== ObjectFile 1.91 =============================

1. Even more namespace cleanup.
2. Define OFILE_STD_IN_NAMESPACE in odefs.h to use STL that is defined
in the std:: namespace. Also uses stl header file names without extension.
3. Maximum file size exceeded situation checked for. cOFileMaxLength in
odefs.h defines this to 2GB. It can be 4GB on Win32.
4. OClassId_t changed from unsigned int to unsigned short.
5. Manual has been edited. It is worth reprinting. State of file after 
failed commit is more clearly defined.

========================== ObjectFile 1.9 ==============================

1. Namespace cleanup. ClassId should be changed to OClassId_t. odefs.h
still defines ClassId for backward compatibility. You can remove this
if ClassId is already in use in your environment.
2. OUFile adds a function makeWritable(). It is documented in the manual.

========================== ObjectFile 1.81 ==============================

1. OFile::reset() method added.
2. egcs (Linux) compilation fixes.
3. All file names are lowercase for easier UNIX.
4. Tested with Red-Hat Linux egcs g++

========================== ObjectFile 1.8 ==============================

1. A few minor bug fixes.
2. Wide character functions added to streams.
3. OOPrintStream removed (oprstrm.cpp/.h).
4. OOStreamXML added (oosxml.cpp/.h)
5. oPrint virtual method removed from OPersist. Better to use streams
or let the user add his own print method.
6. Tested with  C++ Builder 4.0

========================== ObjectFile 1.7 ==============================

ObjectFile 1.70 (25 December 1997)
1. Many bug fixes resulting from use in a major project.
2. retainIdentity feature.
3. OUFile::save() does rename if possible to avoid a copy.
4. commit() compress parameter now obsolete.

ObjectFile 1.71 (11 June 1998)
1. OIStream::readBits() portability fixed.

========================== ObjectFile 1.6 ==============================

ObjectFile 1.60 (22 July 1997)
1. OblobP: removed compression. Better left to subclass.
2. OblobT: copyToBlob method added.
3. STL Library replaced by more up to date SGI Portable version.
4. Tested and works on Visual C++ 5.0.

ObjectFile 1.61 (4 August 1997)
1. Magic Number.
2. Database portabilty fixes.
